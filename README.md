The-Amoeba-World
================

The Amoeba World is strategy game on Haskell.

It's intended to be example of a lagre-scale application.
It shows the following concepts:

* Domain specific languages - both embedded and external (parsing, translating);
* Functional Reactive Programming (netwire lib is currently used);
* Monads and monadic types as high-level unification of the DSLs;
* Software transactional memory;
* And another cool things.

This project is also a source material of the articles about large-scale design in FP:
